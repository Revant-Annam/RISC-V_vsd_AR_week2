# VSDBabySoC - Week 2 Research

## About This Week

This repository explores the fundamentals of **System-on-Chip (SoC) design** through the functional modeling and simulation of the **VSDBabySoC**. 

### What is an SoC?

An SoC (System-on-Chip) is a complete computer system integrated onto a single chip, combining components like a CPU, memory, and peripherals to create a compact and power-efficient unit.

### What is VSDBabySoC?

The VSDBabySoC is a simplified, open-source learning platform designed to teach core SoC concepts. It integrates three essential IP blocks:

- üß† **RVMYTH Core**: A 32-bit RISC-V CPU that acts as the "brain" of the system
- ‚è±Ô∏è **8x PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)**: A clock generator that provides the high-frequency "heartbeat" synchronizing the entire chip
- üîä **10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)**: An interface that translates the chip's digital output into real-world analog signals

## Key Learning Concepts

This project demonstrates essential SoC design principles:

**SoC Integration** - Connect and verify different digital and analog IP cores

**Mixed-Signal Design** - Simulate systems combining digital logic (CPU) and analog components (PLL and DAC)

**Multi-Voltage Domains** - Handle different voltage levels (1.8V core, 3.3V peripherals)

**Functional Modeling** - Validate architecture and logic at high-level before implementation, catching issues early and cost-effectively
